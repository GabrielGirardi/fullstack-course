# fullstack-course

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to storing all the activities and notes from my Full Stack course on Udemy. Here, you'll find comprehensive documentation of my learning journey, including in-class exercises and important insights.

For larger projects, I've created separate repositories, and you can find links to these projects in the README.md file when they become available. This repository serves as a centralized hub for my Full Stack learning experience, providing a clear overview of the concepts covered and the progress made throughout the course.

Feel free to explore the code, share feedback, and follow along with my Full Stack development adventure!
